Look at the readme file, at first, it was a game I did but I think I didn't lost this time ! I may be wring.


I will share the drawing of the game soon.
The purpose was, after creating the game, to investigate components of the RAM for PCs. First, we can use log(x) to
check metals types. Then, as I found something in telecom field, using plancks constant and then it, in addition, I got those
equations because I searched for dirac relationship :

So, how to combine differential equations and log(f(x)) as the most simple case is log(f(x)) = y*y' ?
Obviously said (the previous sentence), we can reuse log(f(x)) again after that formula. If I'm not
wrong, log(x) gives titan metals. So, if I use my particle conductors (project 1 and project 2), 
we have to force collisions with titans particles and see what happens ! I don't have a particle conductor, this is forbidden.
As I said, I might be wrong, but it' s so exciting !
